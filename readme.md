# lew's big ass inspo repo™
lew's big ass inspo repo™ is an attempt to create a folder of everything, from images to songs which serve to inspire me. Unfortunately I can't find the source for most of the images, nor do I have the time or the effort to manually categorize each file. Google's reverse image search is your best friend if you're trying to find the source of an image. A lot of this dump is low quality - it's probably because it's been downloaded from pinterest or instagram, both of which heavily compress their files.

I might implement deduping after this folder gets above 500 files but for now it's done manually.

Enjoy!

PS: The goal for this repo is to make it as large as possible: I think that quantity over quality is better when you need to be inspired :)

## NSFW

The folder could *potentially* have some light NSFW content in it. So maybe don't open it at work.

## Contributing
I'm very open to pull requests! After you've added files, just run `./order img/` and the folder will be automatically renamed (courtesy of nil). Try and stick to the general theme - apart from that, go wild!
